# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 8th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some more functionality to the Habits module, Type Casted major portions of code

**Thoughts:** I am adding minor functionality, but I still feel like I am procrastinating on implementing the difficult parts of the code, so I need to start getting to that. Also, need to figure out how to do TDD, because that is an useful skill. I also made a lot of my previous code more reusable, so I think I am getting better at code architecture?

**Programming Languages and Skills Used**: Python (Yeah, didn't really use much of my Data Structures or Algorithm Knowledge)

**Link to work:** [Am-I-Better](http://https://github.com/wesrer/Am-I-better)
